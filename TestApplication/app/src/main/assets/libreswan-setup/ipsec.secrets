# This file holds shared secrets (PSK) and XAUTH user passwords used for
# authentication.  See pluto(8) manpage or the libreswan website.

# Unlike older openswan, this file does NOT contain any X.509 related
# information such as private key :RSA statements as these now reside

# The preferred method for adding secrets is to create a new file in
# the /etc/ipsec.d/ directory, so it will be included via the include
# line below

include /etc/ipsec.d/*.secrets
